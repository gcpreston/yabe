          Collected Data
        </h2>

        The data that Yabe collects includes the user’s email address, salted and encrypted password, and any listings, sales or purchases that the user makes. Website usage information may also be collected, including the time and date that the website is visited, any interactions such as website navigation, and the time and date of transactions. All information is collected through Yabe’s website, and does not use any third party sources.

        <h2>
          Data Privacy
        </h2>

        As a seller, your username and listings will be public. Users' emails will also be made public under individual profile pages. Only you, and Yabe will be able to see any transactions that you have participated in, and this information will not be shared with third parties. Website usage information will not be shared with third parties, and used to improve the usability of Yabe.

        <h2>
          Data Storage
        </h2>

        All data that is collected will be stored in a private database operated by Yabe. Passwords are salted and encrypted. A copy of the user’s data will be available upon request. As each transaction involves two parties, this data will remain on Yabe’s servers even if your account is deleted.
